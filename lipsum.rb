Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! File not found. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! So I really am important?"
