     <p class="ipsum">I never loved you. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I love you, buddy! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Negative, bossy meat creature! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! File not found. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! So I really am important?</p>
